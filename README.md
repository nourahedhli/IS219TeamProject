# Calculator (Directory)
## Calculator Class
### That has all the math methods below in one file that makes it easier to call it later. 

# Methods 
### Addition  
#### Addition Function: Sum of two numbers
### Subtract   
#### Subtraction function that subtract two numbers 
### Square    
#### Square Function: Square the numbers 
### SquareRoot     
#### SquareRoot function: that squareRoot a number
### Division     
#### Division Function: Divide two numbers. Catch error with Except if it is divided by a zero. 
### Product   
#### Product function, that multiply two numbers 


# Statistic (Directory )
## Statistics
### Has all the Stats Methods below 
## Methods Stats Function
### Mean
 #### Call the addition and division method.
### Median 
 #### Call the division method.
### Mode
## Calculate most common integer
### Standard Deviation
#### Call the mean  and square method
### Variance 
#### Call the function Standard Deviation and use the Calculator class for the square method.
### Quartiles
#### Use the Numpy library . 
### Skewness
#### Use the Scipy Library 
### Sample Correlation
#### Use the calculator class by calling addition , square , subtraction and square root methods 

### Population Correlation
#### Use the calculator class by calling addition , square , subtraction and square root methods 
### Z-Score
#### Use Scipy Library 
### Use mean and population variance methods
#### Mean Deviation / Mean Absolute Deviation
#### Use the Numpy Library
### Population Sampling Function (Statistics)
#### Simple random sampling
#### Use as sample data for formulas and tests 
### Systematic sampling 
#### Use the Calculator class to call the addition method.
### Confidence Interval For a Sample
#### Use the Mean, Z-score and Standard Dev methods
### Margin of Error
##### Use the Z-score, Standard Dev, square root methods
### Sample Size Formula (known, unknown, Cochran’s)
#### Use Scipy Library
### Use the product, square, division, margin error, mean confidence interval, sample standard deviation, and Z-score class methods
### Additional Modules				
#### Helper Functions (Functions you use for checking types or performing repeated operations)
#### Call Type Method in the Calculator class to test if the “a”  and “b” are not String type before calculating. 
Random Number Generator




## Random Generator function 
### Generate a random number without a seed between a range of two numbers - Both Integer and Decimal
### Generate a random number with a seed between a range of two numbers - Both Integer and Decimal
### Generate a list of N random numbers with a seed and between a range of numbers - Both Integer and Decimal
## Select a random item from a list
 ### Set a seed and randomly.select the same value from a list
### Select N number of items from a list without a seed
### Select N number of items from a list with a seed




## 2.  A list of task that break each development task down to the function level.  Each task requires a description, formula, and an example of the formula with data and the result of the calculation. 
## 3.  A Gitub Repository and a Project that has a 4 column chart: Todo, In progress, Review, Done.  
### ToDo Shows your Tasks List
#### In progress needs to show the task assigned to a developer
#### Review needs to be for pull requests to review and who did the review
#### Done is for complete tasks

## Program Requirements
### Demonstrate the use of overloading / polymorphism to reduce the high level names of functions by using the same name with different parameter types
### Demonstrate inheritance by extending the calculator
### Demonstrate encapsulation by having the calculator have methods and a result property
### Demonstrate abstraction by layering your code and using static methods.  Object methods should call static methods to perform the operation.
### Check values for being valid numbers and not strings
### Throw exception for empty list
### Use random data for tests and be able to increase the number of calculations required i.e. be able to increase the list of numbers that the mean calculation is done on.  You can actually use built in libraries or 3rd party libraries to check your calculations that you complete yourself.  i.e. you can use the standard deviation function from a stats library to compute the correct value for your list of random numbers and then use that to test that your own calculation is correct for that list.
